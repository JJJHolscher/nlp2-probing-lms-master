# __Probing Language Models__
#
# This notebook serves as a start for your NLP2 assignment on probing Language Models. This notebook will become part of the contents that you will submit at the end, so make sure to keep your code (somewhat) clean :-)
#
# __note__: This is only the second time anyone is doing this assignment. That's exciting! But it might well be the case that certain aspects are too unclear. Do not hesitate at all to reach to me once you get stuck, I'd be grateful to help you out.
#
# __note 2__: This assignment is not dependent on big fancy GPUs. I run all this stuff on my own 3 year old CPU, without any Colab hassle. So it's up to you to decide how you want to run it.

# # Models
#
# For the Transformer models you are advised to make use of the `transformers` library of Huggingface: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
# Their library is well documented, and they provide great tools to easily load in pre-trained models.

# %%
#
## Your code for initializing the transformer model(s)
#
# Note that most transformer models use their own `tokenizer`, that should be loaded in as well.
#
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2Model



model = GPT2Model.from_pretrained('gpt2')
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')


# Note that some models don't return the hidden states by default.
# This can be configured by passing `output_hidden_states=True` to the `from_pretrained` method.


# %%
#
## Your code for initializing the rnn model(s)
#
# The Gulordava LSTM model can be found here:
# https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Lp3AM4NEPycp_IBgoHfLc_V456pmUom/view?usp=sharing
#
# N.B: I have altered the RNNModel code to only output the hidden states that you are interested in.
# If you want to do more experiments with this model you could have a look at the original code here:
# https://github.com/facebookresearch/colorlessgreenRNNs/blob/master/src/language_models/model.py

lstm = RNNModel('LSTM', 50001, 650, 650, 2)

# It is a good idea that before you move on, you try to feed some text to your LMs; and check if everything works accordingly.
# %% [markdown]
# # Data
#
# For this assignment you will train your probes on __treebank__ corpora. A treebank is a corpus that has been *parsed*, and stored in a representation that allows the parse tree to be recovered. Next to a parse tree, treebanks also often contain information about part-of-speech tags, which is exactly what we are after now.
#
# The treebank you will use for now is part of the Universal Dependencies project. I provide a sample of this treebank as well, so you can test your setup on that before moving on to larger amounts of data.
#
# Make sure you accustom yourself to the format that is created by the `conllu` library that parses the treebank files before moving on. For example, make sure you understand how you can access the pos tag of a token, or how to cope with the tree structure that is formed using the `to_tree()` functionality.

# %%
# READ DATA

# # Generating Representations
#
# We now have our data all set, our models are running and we are good to go!
#
# The next step is now to create the model representations for the sentences in our corpora. Once we have generated these representations we can store them, and train additional diagnostic (/probing) classifiers on top of the representations.
#
# There are a few things you should keep in mind here. Read these carefully, as these tips will save you a lot of time in your implementation.
# 1. Transformer models make use of Byte-Pair Encodings (BPE), that chunk up a piece of next in subword pieces. For example, a word such as "largely" could be chunked up into "large" and "ly". We are interested in probing linguistic information on the __word__-level. Therefore, we will follow the suggestion of Hewitt et al. (2019a, footnote 4), and create the representation of a word by averaging over the representations of its subwords. So the representation of "largely" becomes the average of that of "large" and "ly".
#
#
# 2. Subword chunks never overlap multiple tokens. In other words, say we have a phrase like "None of the", then the tokenizer might chunk that into "No"+"ne"+" of"+" the", but __not__ into "No"+"ne o"+"f the", as those chunks overlap multiple tokens. This is great for our setup! Otherwise it would have been quite challenging to distribute the representation of a subword over the 2 tokens it belongs to.
#
#
# 3. **Important**: If you closely examine the provided treebank, you will notice that some tokens are split up into multiple pieces, that each have their own POS-tag. For example, in the first sentence the word "Al-Zaman" is split into "Al", "-", and "Zaman". In such cases, the conllu `TokenList` format will add the following attribute: `('misc', OrderedDict([('SpaceAfter', 'No')]))` to these tokens. Your model's tokenizer does not need to adhere to the same tokenization. E.g., "Al-Zaman" could be split into "Al-"+"Za"+"man", making it hard to match the representations with their correct pos-tag. Therefore I recommend you to not tokenize your entire sentence at once, but to do this based on the chunking of the treebank. <br /><br />
# Make sure to still incoporate the spaces in a sentence though, as these are part of the BPE of the tokenizer. That is, the tokenizer uses a different token id for `"man"`, than it does for `" man"`: the former could be part of `" woman"`=`" wo`"+`"man"`, whereas the latter would be the used in case *man* occurs at the start of a word. The tokenizer for GPT-2 adds spaces at the start of a token (represented as a `Ä ` symbol). This means that you should keep track whether the previous token had the `SpaceAfter` attribute set to `'No'`: in case it did not, you should manually prepend a `" "` ahead of the token.
#
#
# 4. The LSTM LM does not have the issues related to subwords, but is far more restricted in its vocabulary. Make sure you keep the above points in mind though, when creating the LSTM representations. You might want to write separate functions for the LSTM, but that is up to you.
#
#
# 5. **N.B.**: Make sure that when you run a sentence through your model, you do so within a `with torch.no_grad():` block, and that you have run `model.eval()` beforehand as well (to disable dropout).
#
#
# 6. **N.B.**: Make sure to use a token's ``["form"]`` attribute, and not the ``["lemma"]``, as the latter will stem any relevant morphological information from the token. We don't want this, because we want to feed well-formed, grammatical sentences to our model.
#
#
# I would like to stress that if you feel hindered in any way by the simple code structure that is presented here, you are free to modify it :-) Just make sure it is clear to an outsider what you're doing, some helpful comments never hurt.

# Now that we are able to map edge distances back to parse trees, we can create code for our quantitative evaluation. For this we will use the Undirected Unlabeled Attachment Score (UUAS), which is expressed as:
#
# $$\frac{\text{number of predicted edges that are an edge in the gold parse tree}}{\text{number of edges in the gold parse tree}}$$
#
# To do this, we will need to obtain all the edges from our MST matrix. Note that, since we are using undirected trees, that an edge can be expressed in 2 ways: an edge between node $i$ and node $j$ is denoted by both `mst[i,j] = 1`, or `mst[j,i] = 1`.
#
# You will write code that computes the UUAS score for a matrix of predicted distances, and the corresponding gold distances. I recommend you to split this up into 2 methods: 1 that retrieves the edges that are present in an MST matrix, and one general method that computes the UUAS score.

# # Structural Probes
#
# We now have everything in place to start doing the actual exciting stuff: training our structural probe!
#
# To make life easier for you, we will simply take the `torch` code for this probe from John Hewitt's repository. This allows you to focus on the training regime from now on.

# I have provided a rough outline for the training regime that you can use. Note that the hyper parameters that I provide here only serve as an indication, but should be (briefly) explored by yourself.
#
# As can be seen in Hewitt's code above, there exists functionality in the probe to deal with batched input. It is up to you to use that: a (less efficient) method can still incorporate batches by doing multiple forward passes for a batch and computing the backward pass only once for the summed losses of all these forward passes. (_I know, this is not the way to go, but in the interest of time that is allowed ;-), the purpose of the assignment is writing a good paper after all_).

'''
Similar to the `create_data` method of the previous notebook, I recommend you to use a method
that initialises all the data of a corpus. Note that for your embeddings you can use the
`fetch_sen_reps` method again. However, for the POS probe you concatenated all these representations into
1 big tensor of shape (num_tokens_in_corpus, model_dim).

The StructuralProbe expects its input to contain all the representations of 1 sentence, so I recommend you
to update your `fetch_sen_reps` method in a way that it is easy to retrieve all the representations that
correspond to a single sentence.
